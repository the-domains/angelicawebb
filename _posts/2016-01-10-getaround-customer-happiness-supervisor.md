# Getaround - Customer Happiness Supervisor

I'm currently a Customer Happiness Supervisor at Getaround. It's a car sharing service in the sharing economy. Think of Airbnb... for your car!

It's my job to support and solve the problems for car owners and renters via email, phone, and social media. I also manage a remote team of tier 1 reps. There's never a dull moment! This job has really taught me how to think on my feet and allowed me to use my creative problem solving skills.
